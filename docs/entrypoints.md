# Entrypoints and use
This document describes the business entrypoints and their arguments. All argument lists are represented in Michelson as location retaining right combed trees.

## FA2 token operations
FA2 entrypoints are at the time unimplemented, making the internal tokens untransferrable. Internal structure is in place to implement a standard FA2 token interface.
